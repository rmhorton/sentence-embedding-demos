More in detail, my approach is to take a pretrained model, remove the last layer and fine-tune it on the dataset we're considering.\\nConsider the model and learning rate which gives the highest accuracy.\\nImprove the accuracy by grouping classes that are often confused. This is done by looking at the confusion matrix.\\n\\nDo you think this is a good approach to use? And which models should I consider in the first place?

I'm a bit of a CNN newbie, and I'm trying to train one to image classify pictures of pretty similar looking particles. I'm making the inputs and labels by hand from a set of 48x48 grayscale images, and labeling them with a one-hot vector based on their position in the sequence (for example, the 400/1000th image might have a one-hot in the 4th position if I have 10 categories in the run). I'm using sigmoidal output activation and categorical cross entropy loss. I've played around with a few different optimizers, as well. I'm implementing in python keras. \\nUnfortunately, although I have pretty good accuracy numbers for the training and validation, when I actually look at the outputs being produced, it generally gives multiple categories, which is not at all what I want. For example, if I have 6 categories and a label of 3, it might give the following probability vector:\\n[ .99 .98  1.0  .99  0.02  0.05 ]\\nIt was my understanding that categorical cross entropy would not allow this type of categorization, and yet it is prevalent in my code. I am under the impression that I'm doing something fundamentally wrong, but I cant figure out what. Any help would be appreciated. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>How to use CNN for making predictions on non-image data? I have a dataset which I have loaded as a data frame in Python. It consists of 21392 rows (the data instances, each row is one sample) and 1972 columns (the features). The last column i.e. column 1972 has string type labels (14 different categories of target labels). I would like to use a CNN to classify the data in this case and predict the target labels using the available features. This is a somewhat unconventional approach though it seems possible. However, I am very confused on how the methodology should be as I could not find any sample code/ pseudo code guiding on using CNN for Classifying non-image data, either in Tensorflow or Keras. Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated. Cheers!\\n</td>\n",

As an approach, I am using the following:\\n\\nConsidering the main available models, check their accuracy for the considered dataset at different learning rates. More in detail, my approach is to take a pretrained model, remove the last layer and fine-tune it on the dataset we're considering.\\nConsider the model and learning rate which gives the highest accuracy.\\nImprove the accuracy by grouping classes that are often confused. This is done by looking at the confusion matrix.\\n\\nDo you think this is a good approach to use? And which models should I consider in the first place? As of now I'm looking into the ResNet family (18, 34, 50, 101, 152 layers) and visual transformers.\\n   \n",

I have a dataset which I have loaded as a data frame in Python. It consists of 21392 rows (the data instances, each row is one sample) and 1972 columns (the features). The last column i.e. column 1972 has string type labels (14 different categories of target labels). I would like to use a CNN to classify the data in this case and predict the target labels using the available features. This is a somewhat unconventional approach though it seems possible. However, I am very confused on how the methodology should be as I could not find any sample code/ pseudo code guiding on using CNN for Classifying non-image data, either in Tensorflow or Keras. Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated. Cheers!\\n   \n",

       "15065  How to use residual learning applied to fully connected networks? Is there any reason why skip connections would not provide the same benefits to fully connected layers as it does for convolutional?\\nI've read the ResNet paper and it says that the applications should extend to \"non-vision\" problems, so I decided to give it a try for a tabular data project I'm working on.\\nTry 1: My first try was to only skip connections when the input to a block matched the output size of the block (the block has depth - 1 number of layers with in_dim nodes plus a layer with out_dim nodes :\\nclass ResBlock(nn.Module):\\n    def __init__(self, depth, in_dim, out_dim, act='relu', act_first=True):\\n        super().__init__()\\n        self.residual = nn.Identity()\\n        self.block = block(depth, in_dim, out_dim, act)\\n        self.ada_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(out_dim)\\n        self.activate = get_act(act)\\n        self.apply_shortcut = (in_dim == out_dim)\\n        \\n    def forward(self, x):\\n        if self.apply_shortcut:\\n            residual = self.residual(x)\\n     \\n            x = self.block(x)\\n            return self.activate(x + residual)\\n        return self.activate(self.block(x))\\n\\nThe accompanying loss curve:\\n\\nTry 2: I thought to myself \"Great, it's doing something!\", so then I decided to reset and go for 30 epochs from scratch. I don't have the image saved, but this training only made it 5 epochs and then the training and validation loss curves exploded by several orders of magnitude:\\n\\nTry 3: Next, I decided to try to implement the paper's idea of reducing the input size to match the output when they don't match: y = F(x, {Wi}) + Mx. I chose average pooling in place of matrix M to accomplish this, and my loss curve became.\\n\\nThe only difference in my code is that I added average pooling so I could use shortcut connections when input and output sizes are different:\\nclass ResBlock(nn.Module):\\n    def __init__(self, depth, in_dim, out_dim, act='relu', act_first=True):\\n        super().__init__()\\n        self.residual = nn.Identity()\\n        self.block = block(depth, in_dim, out_dim, act)\\n        # squeeze/pad input  to output size\\n        self.ada_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(out_dim) \\n        self.activate = get_act(act)\\n        self.apply_pool = (in_dim != out_dim)\\n        \\n    def forward(self, x):\\n        # if in and out dims are different apply the padding/squeezing:\\n        if self.apply_pool:\\n            residual = self.ada_pool(self.residual(x).unsqueeze(0)).squeeze(0)\\n        else: residual = self.residual(x)\\n            \\n        x = self.block(x)\\n        return self.activate(x + residual)\\n)\\n\\nIs there a conceptual error in my application of residual learning? A bug in my code? Or is resididual learning just not applicable to this kind of data/network?\\n   \n",

I am trying to better understand the Least Mean Squares algorithm, in order to implement it programmatically.\\nIf we consider its weight updating formula $$w(n+1) = w(n) + \\rho * \\text{error}(i)x(i),$$ where $w(n + 1)$ is the new weight of the classifier function, $w(n)$ is its current weight and $x(i)$ is the $i$th element of a training dataset, what should $\\rho$ be?\\nFrom what I have found online, $ρ$ is supposed to be $0 < \\rho < \\frac{2}{trace(X^TX)}$, where $X$ is a matrix with all the training data the algorithm has processed at that point. One idea that I had, was to take $\\rho = \\frac{1}{trace(X^TX)} < \\frac{2}{trace(X^TX)}$, but I do not know if that is correct. Also, one characteristic that this value has is that it changes with each iteration of the algorithm, as more samples are added to matrix $X$.\\nSo, what is a good value for $\\rho$? Should it change during the execution of the algorithm or should it stay the same?\\n   \n",

I've been researching Adversarial Machine Learning and I know that causative attacks are when an attacker manipulates training data. An exploratory attack is when the attacker wants to find out about the machine learning model. However, there is not a lot of information on how an attacker can manipulate only training data and not the test data set. \\nI have read about scenarios where the attacker performs an exploratory attack to find out about the ML model and then perform malicious input in order to tamper with the training data so that the model gives the wrong output. However shouldn't such input manipulation affect both the test and training data set? How does such tampering only affect the training data set and not the test data set?\\n   \n",

What kind of features does each node have as an input graph to a graph neural network? For example, we want to do image classification with GNN, what are the features of each pixel? Or if anyone could send me a link to implementing GNN on an example I would greatly appreciate it.\\n   \n",
