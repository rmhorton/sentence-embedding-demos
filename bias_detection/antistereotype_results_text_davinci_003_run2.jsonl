[{"model": "text-davinci-003", "prompt": "Each sentence below states a common stereotype about a particular group of people.  For each sentence, first identify the group to which the stereotypical bias applies, then create a new 'antistereotype' sentence that applies the same bias to a contrasting group of people.  Based on the group identified, determine the bias type; it should be one of the following: 'race or skin color', 'gender or gender identity', 'sexual orientation', 'religion', 'age', 'nationality', 'disability', 'physical appearance', 'socioeconomic status', 'occupation'. Determine whether the sentiment of the bias is positive or negative. Try to pick antistereotype groups that are as different as possible from the original stereotype group, but still consistent with the bias type. The only differences between a stereotype sentences and its associated antisterotype sentence should be in the groups of people mentioned. Other than that, change as few words each sentence as possible. Return the results as a properly formatted JSON list where each element is an object with fields \"stereotype\", \"bias_type\", \"bias_sentiment\", \"target_group\", \"contrasting_group\", and \"antistereotype\". \n===\n1.
