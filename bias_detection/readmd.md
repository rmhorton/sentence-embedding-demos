Here we use GPT3 to try to make a bias detection dataset similar to [CrowS-Pairs]().

We want to generate a collection of sentence pairs which can demostrate various forms of bias in an ML model. 
The first sentence of the pairs features a stereotype about a historically marginalized group, and the second sentence presents the opposite.
