Depending on when you fly, your ticket class, and how close to your departure date that you buy your tickets, pricing can vary from less than $100 (91 Euros) to over $500 (455 Euros). Be sure to plan your trip and purchase tickets in advance to ensure that you save money. Also, while Munich has one major airport (MUC), Rome has two large international airports (FCO and CIA).

By train - Traveling by train is another common way to get from Munich to Rome. While it will take longer than by air, tickets are very inexpensive and can be purchased the day of travel. A one way train ticket from Munich to Rome will cost roughly $35 (32 Euros), and take between 9-12 hours, depending on the route and number of stops.\n\n3. By car - Traveling by car from Munich to Rome is also an option. With limited stops, it will take roughly 10 hours to drive from Munich to Rome, but having a car will allow you flexibility to stop along the way at any cities or sites that you want to see. \n\nDepending on your specific needs, all three of these options could be viable ways to travel from Munich to Rome.","inst_A06","inst_B19","resp_A18","resp_B79"],["Classify each of the following European countries as either members of the European Union or non-members of the European Union: Spain, Albania, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Romania, Germany.","Germany, Spain, Ireland, and Romania are all members of the European Union.

The term derives from the Atlantic Ocean, which is bordered by North America and Europe.\n\nThe term can be used in a more specific way to refer to support for North Atlantic military alliances against the Soviet Union, or in a more expansive way to imply broader cooperation, perceived deeply shared values, a merging of diplomatic cultures, as well as a sense of community and some degree of integration between North America and Europe. In practice, the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American, particularly American, engagement in Europe and close cooperation between states on both sides of the ocean. Atlanticism manifested itself most strongly during the Second World War and in its aftermath, the Cold War, through the establishment of various Euro-Atlantic institutions, most importantly NATO and the Marshall Plan.\n\nAtlanticism varies in strength from region to region and from country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors. It is often considered to be particularly strong in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Ireland and the United Kingdom (linked to the Special Relationship). Politically, it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically but not exclusively with classical liberals or the political right in Europe. Atlanticism often implies an affinity for U.S. political or social culture, or affinity for Europe in North America, as well as the historical bonds between the two continents.\n\nThere is some tension between Atlanticism and continentalism on both sides of the Atlantic, with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans-Atlantic cooperation. The relationship between Atlanticism and North American or European integrations is complex, and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators. Internationalism is the foreign policy belief combining both Atlanticism and continentalism.","inst_A06","inst_B21","resp_A18","resp_B79"],["In which part of Germany is the town Kirchenlamitz located?","Bavaria","inst_A06","inst_B23","resp_A18","resp_B79"],["Which of the other locations mentioned in this article is closest to Rudzk Duży?","Piotrków Kujawski.

Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. \\n\\nWhen you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you\\u2019ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that\\u2019s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don\\u2019t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.\\n\\nSo, that\\u2019s my answer. Learn at least as much theory as you need to know to understand the rules you want to break.\\nIndian and Western music differ considerably in terms of pitch because Western music adheres to the concept of absolute pitch, while Indian music predominantly focuses on relative pitch. Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \\\"A2\\\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \\n\\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \\\"sa\\\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range.\\n1. During the 20th century's folk revival, traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that resulted from it both fell under the umbrella term of folk music.\\n2. Some folk music subgenres may be referred to as world music. Traditional folk music has been described in a variety of ways, including as music that has been passed down orally, has unknown composers, is played on traditional instruments, is about cultural or national identity, changes between generations (folk process), is connected to a people's folklore, or is performed as part of long-standing custom.\\n3. It has been put in opposition to classical and commercial styles.\\nTypes of instruments are: french Horn, oboe, drums, flute, and tuba. Types of school subjects are: mathematics, history, physical education, science, and geography.\\nThere are several differences between acoustic guitars and classic (nylon) guitars. \\n1) The strings in acoustic guitars are made of steel, but for a classic guitar they are made of nylon.\\n2) the second difference is in the sound and tone they are producing. The sound created by an acoustic guitar is more crisp and twangy as apposed to the one created by a classic guitar which is more mellow.\\n3) The third difference is in the shape and body. The neck of an classic guitar is wider.\\nThere are so many keys in Florida to choose from!

The opening notes of \\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\\" filled the arena, and the band appeared on stage, their silhouettes shrouded in smoke and fog.\\n\\nThe band members seamlessly transitioned from one song to the next, with each track taking the audience on a journey through Pink Floyd's extensive discography. The pulsating rhythms of \\\"Another Brick in the Wall\\\" and \\\"Money\\\" had the crowd dancing and singing along, while the haunting melodies of \\\"Comfortably Numb\\\" and \\\"Wish You Were Here\\\" elicited tears from some.\\n\\nBut it wasn't just the music that made the Pink Floyd concert so mesmerizing. The light show and visuals were equally stunning. Giant inflatables of Pink Floyd's iconic characters, including the famous pig from the \\\"Animals\\\" album cover, floated above the stage, while lasers and projections created a psychedelic atmosphere that enhanced the music.\\n\\nAs the band reached the epic finale of \\\"Echoes,\\\" the audience was transported to another world, with the intricate soundscapes and otherworldly visuals creating an otherworldly experience.

Graduation being his first stadium album that really skyrocketed Kanye into the mainstream resulting in sold out tours and solidifying pop culture relevance. The fundamentalists fight for The College Dropout as it is a reflection of a simpler time and arguably his most honest and well produced album to date. The construction of this album was the subject of the Netflix 2022 documentary Jeen-yus.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, there is no right or wrong answer. Every person has a Kanye album that is their GOAT as it were. One cannot answer this question objectively. Such is life and the question itself reflects that journey so beautifully.

I have given it a lot of thought and done a great deal of research into what might be involved. I am aware that having a pet is a huge commitment so I am writing to you to explain why I think you should buy me a pet tortoise and why a tortoise is a fantastic choice of pet.\\n\\nLooking after a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility. I know that I will have to ensure my tortoise is well fed, kept at the right temperature, given opportunities to bask under a heated lamp or in the sunshine if warm enough. I am very willing to give the time and commitment necessary to look after my tortoise. The tortoise will be my sole responsibility and I feel mature enough to commit to its care and happiness.\\n\\nAs you know, I suffer from anxiety and school makes me particularly worried sometimes. It has been shown through numerous studies that pets reduce anxiety and stress in humans. I feel sure that having a tortoise will be a fantastic distraction from my worries and bring me great enjoyment. Contrary to popular belief, tortoises love having their shells stroked and their chins tickled and I think it would be very relaxing for me to pet a tortoise when I get home from school.\\n\\nTortoises are very self-sufficient. Provided they are given a warm place to bask, access to fresh water and plenty of fresh food such as dandelions, kale, lettuce and other leafy vegetables, they are very happy to be left to their own devices. As we live in the UK where temperatures can be cool, we would need to purchase a tortoise table with good substrate, a basking lamp and some hides where the tortoise can tuck itself away. We have lots of space for this in our kitchen. When it is warm, the tortoise can go into our garden in an enclosure. A tortoise table and lamp will cost about \\u00a3200 but this is just an initial outlay. Thereafter, keeping a tortoise is very cheap. In fact, you can pick most of their food for free by foraging which I am happy to do when we go for families walk.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, tortoises can be very friendly. As I have mentioned above, they love being stroked but did you also know that they can recognise their owners and some can even respond to their names? In fact, a study showed that tortoises can recognise their previous owners that they haven\\u2019t seen in years so they are both friendly and very intelligent.\\nYou might be worried about hibernating a tortoise but I have done lots of research on this and now know exactly what to do. If we buy a tortoise, it will need to hibernate for a maximum of three months from the end of September. We will need to hibernate our tortoise in a well-insulated box. The temperature mustn\\u2019t go above or below 5 degrees celsius and our garage would be the perfect place for it. We have a temperature gauge in there so I can keep an eye on the heat levels. \\n\\nFinally, I have looked into the cost of buying a tortoise. I would suggest we buy a tortoise which is a couple of years\\u2019 old as they require less care. We can buy a preloved tortoise which has been microchipped for about \\u00a3100. And when we go on holiday, I have found a Tortoise Hotel which is run by a vet and costs just \\u00a360 for a 10 day stay.\\n\\nI think you will agree that I have conducted very thorough research into looking after a tortoise and I hope you will agree that I am now mature enough to look after a pet. I truly believe that a pet tortoise will give me a strong sense of responsibility and will have a positive calming effect on my mood. Indeed, I think the whole family will enjoy having a tortoise. They are friendly, loving, interesting and intelligent animals and we will all benefit from having one.\\n\\nI would be grateful if you would give my request full consideration.\\n\\nLots of Love,\\n\\nWilf x\\nSome famous orange cats include Tigger, Heathcliff, Garfield, Crookshanks, and Morris.\\nCats are all individuals, they each may have different personality traits. Some common personality traits that humans typically ascribe to cats include loving, standoffish, active, aloof, playful, and compassionate.\\nThere are a few different ways you can train your cat to stop meowing:\\n- Get a clicker, and whenever she pauses her meowing, click the clicker and give her a treat. The clicker trains her to associate her behavior with the reward.\\n- Find something else to entertain her, such as a cat toy, or a video of wildlife.\\n- Build an outdoor enclosure for her, accessible from a cat door. This will allow her to go outside, but in a safe and controller environment.\\nMostly yes! immunity increases of humans with pets excluding the people with pet dander allergy. Thoughts to ponder for growing up kids who are exposed to pets build a higher level of immunity and resilience. Added to the unconditional LOVE the pet offers.\\nIf a cat is not immediately friendly, one of the best ways to approach a cat is by offering it treats.  Even timid cats can be tempted if you figure out what foods they really like.  Start with a smelly food like tuna fish or tinned chicken, or raw meat cat treats if you have them.  Don't expect the cat to approach you immediately.  Put the treat on the ground and sit nearby.  Be careful not to stare at the cat since that is an aggressive gesture.  If the cat takes the treat, try throwing or laying out another treat, this time a bit closer to you.  Repeat until the cat is nearby.  It will learn to associate you with happiness (food).\"},{\"type_label\":\"response_cluster::resp_B05\",\"count\":122,\"prevalence\":0.0081273733,\"id\":107,\"type\":\"response_cluster\",\"label\":\"resp_B05\",\"color\":\"#FFFF99\",\"shape\":\"ellipse\",\"title\":\"resp_B05\\n(response_cluster, 122 examples)\\nHumans like dogs because dogs love humans and want to be with them. Humans and dogs share a close emotional connection that is unmatched by other species, including \\u2013 at times \\u2013 other humans. There is evidence of a humans and dogs interacting going back 18,000 years. Domesticated dogs will quickly bond to a humans, often showing affection in presence of their human owners and degrees of separation anxiety when their human owners aren\\u2019t present. Dogs will seek comfort from their human when they feel anxious or are in physical distress. Dogs often seek approval from their human by performing specific tasks in which they have been trained, or by exhibiting character traits or behaviors that they have been selectively bred for. Dogs love humans and interact with them in complex ways. Humans, in turn, interact with dogs and receive emotional satisfaction.\\nThere are many pros and cons of pet ownership. On the positive side interacting with your pet can provide a great way of relaxing and reducing stress in your life. If your pet is a dog it can be a great way to encourage you to get exercise. If you have a young child it can be a way of teaching them responsibility. On the down side, owning a per means you are obligated to feed, clean up after and otherwise take care of them - responsibilities you will have no matter what else going on in your life.\\nHumans like dogs because they make us feel good. When a human pets a dog, oxytocin levels rise in both species, which make both feel emotionally closer. These feelings of closeness make us want to pet them more \\u2013 and the dog wanting to be petted more \\u2013 increasing feelings of closeness and connectedness while engaging in this biological and emotional feedback loop.\\nGolden Retrievers, Labrador Retriever, Poodle, Great Dane, and Boxers\\nHuskies howl when they are excited or anxious. They howl instead of barking because a howl can travel over longer distances and uses less energy.\\nDogs are domesticated animals that usually are more active and rely on their owner.

To that end, we need LASER to generate outputs that would not target racial groups \\u2013 African American communities, for example \\u2013 and in turn aggravate the pre-existing police harassment in those regions. Yet, there exists no possible source of data inputs for LASER to achieve such goal. The algorithm has been historically accused of racial profiling despite not using race as a predictor for criminal tendencies. However, our society is fraught with deep-rooted racism such that data points themselves bear the mark of discriminatory ideology and practices. For instance, gang membership as a predictor in LASER essentially serves as a proxy for race. Gangs in African American communities arose as a result of economic deprivation, resource insufficiency, as well as police harassment \\u2013 phenomena with roots that can be  easily traced back to age-old racial segregation. Similarly, criminal records hold the vestiges of the New Jim Crow. Therefore, using gang activity and past arrests as predictors in the LASER system only generate outputs with heavy racial connotations, which in turn reinforce and reify historical biases.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the problematic algorithm, we do not need to cast away the system entirely. When LASER points to places of deep-rooted discrimination and deprivation, we should mend but not aggravate. Instead of composing chronic offender bulletins, we can treat the LASER outputs as agenda for our next social welfare and infrastructure construction projects \\u2013 where do we need to build more schools and hospitals? Where should the money go to create more job opportunities? Where do we need to address the problem of police misconduct and rebuild the relationship between people and law enforcement? If we cannot fix a \\u201cbias in, bias out\\u201d algorithm, we can at least attend to the information it has generated and figure out where the biases have wreaked havoc and taken a heavy toll. We can then redistribute resources and fundings accordingly so that the historically deprived neighborhoods have the chance to flourish. In doing so, we can achieve both sustainability and equity. We can expect the crime rates to go down when the neighborhood achieves economic growth and employment, and such crime reduction is sustainable, unlike the original LASER system that continues to discriminate and deprive.\\nAn advantage of single-cell multiomics in relation to bulk analysis is to mitigate confounding factors derived from cell to cell variation, allowing the uncovering of heterogeneous tissue architectures.\\nThe best way to understand event based data depends on the particular questions you're trying to answer.

However, in 1999, portions of the Glass-Steagall act, which was passed by congress in 1933, was repealed and as a result, created more overall risk in the financial system as it allowed institutions to commingle low risk real estate investments with riskier investment operations.  The final major factor was a large increase in predatory home loan lending practices which targeted low-income, low-credit, uninformed homebuyers (mostly racial minorities).  The severity of these factors went unnoticed by U.S financial regulators and by the time the effects surfaced, the government was caught by surprise.\\nAlways make sure you have your wallet, keys and phone with you\\nOne of the primary roles of the US Federal Reserve is to control the supply of money within the economy.

In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \\\"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\\\"\\n\\nThis custom of the Easter egg, according to many sources, can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Eastern Europe and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches.

Preparation ensures that the appropriate texture has been introduced to the top layer of the concrete and helps the epoxy to bond with the concrete better. This ensures long-lasting results. All of these different methods of preparing concrete vary in terms of the level of difficulty as well as the efficacy produced. Following are the most popular techniques:\\n\\n1. Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes. This is also the quickest among all the techniques. The downside however is that the etching process may not produce the best concrete texture that ensures a long-lasting bond. \\n2. Walk-behind Concrete Diamond grinder: This produces one of the best results when compared to the other techniques. It involves the use of a walk behind concrete grinder which has been fitted with a diamond grinding attachment. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires specialized equipment which may not be readily available & is a lot more time consuming compared to Acid etching.\\n3. Hand Grinder with Diamond Cup Wheel: This is the most accessible option that yields results that are equivalent to using a walk-behind concrete grinder. The only drawback of this approach is that this is the most time consuming compared to other methods and is only practical for covering small areas.\\nThere are several things you do can to increase the value of your home. First, you can focus on what is known as \\\"curb appeal\\\", essentially making the outside and surrounding of your house attractive.

In the interior of your house, the best places to focus will be in your bathrooms and kitchen. Further, you can replace major appliances and components such as water heaters, furnaces, or the roof to increase the value. Another way to increase the value of your home is by making it bigger. Often, pricing for homes is done by looking at the area of the house, so by adding on new rooms or extra space, you can also increase the overall value of the house.\\nIf you're working in an office and waiting for a meeting room to be cleared out, you can start by making your presence known by gently knocking at the door.

If they still do not leave, you can get more assertive by entering the room or by verbally engaging them to explain that their time is up and you need the room.

Fire Engines are what most people think of when they think of a fire truck. It has a combination of hoses, ladders, and other equipment but also carries several hundred gallons of water and has a built in pump to feed that hoses from it's internal tank or from a hydrant. There are Ladder Trucks which typically have a large extending ladder on top. These may or may not carry water but also generally have a built in pump to feed water to the nozzle attached to the ladder. There are Rescue Trucks which typically have specialized equipment for unique rescue situations such as confined space, vehicle extrication, or collapsed building rescue. These typically don't carry water or pumps but there are a few jurisdictions that have Rescue Engines that blend these two. There are also Tanker trucks that carry large amounts of water to areas where there are no hydrants and they typically do not have their own pumps or hoses.

This same sort of criticism is brought up in the concept of \\u201cthe god-trick\\u201d in Haraway\\u2019s, \\u201cSituated Knowledge: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective.\\u201d Haraway explains this concept as an illusion within which humans compare their own knowledge to the idea of infinite knowledge to that of a god. This sort of intellectual superiority has been a long-standing concept in human history as we have progressed in scientific thought. Described initially in Haraway\\u2019s writing, \\u201cthe god-trick\\u201d remerges in many ideas Nietzsche exemplifies this through various metaphors and explanations of biases through perceptions.\\nThis idea of the \\u201cthe god-trick\\u201d and its qualities of knowing all, stem from humans and their rigid minds, being able to grasp only at what is tangible in their own minds, consequently shutting out other perspectives. Humans approach scientific discovery with a biased view, through their own one-sided viewpoint, and through no fault of their own make scientific discoveries which come from their own observations. But it isn't at this point where human faults are exemplified, Nietzsche argues, rather when scientific discovery is built upon these so-called\\n \\u201cscientific truths.\\u201d It is at this point in time where in a moment notice the concept of science could \\u201cswell up like a balloon at the slightest puff\\u201d because of the very construct of scientific advancement based on falsities (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). Yet, given the knowledge of how fallible so many human discoveries have the potential to be, we still hold on to the idea of superior credibility which can be challenged by no force in our world, in essence, what Haraway refers to. In her idea of the \\u201cthe god-trick,\\u201d Haraway advocates for a different way we approach observations through a different approach to objectivity. In separating ourselves from the almost seemingly personal obligation of being able to understand anything and everything and accepting the complexities of science we are able to remove the idea of false compromise on scientific truths to make up for our lack of understanding.\\nA fundamental idea that is exemplified in Nietzsche\\u2019s writing, is the idea of pride. Pride is a large component of human behavior and many actions are justified. The concept of pride can even be seen as an answer to the implied questions of where the root of the \\u201cgod-trick\\u201d is derived from. From the beginning of time, it can be observed that we humans have had an itch for the idea of conquering. An itch to conquer societies, cultures, land, or even something as simple as higher socioeconomic status. It's quite simply in our blood and has been present for generations of humans. Furthering Haraway\\u2019s argument, Nietzsche presents the idea of how being prideful in the depth of our \\u201cknowledgeable\\u201d we are \\u201cblinding fog over the eyes and senses of men'' exemplifying how pride can produce scientific thought that provides answers just for the sake of answering questions that in reality are faulty (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 7). As a result of this, a curtain of deception is created in which humans have assisted in the creation\\n\\nof their lies which to them have been converted into truth. Scientific discovery from this point on leads to \\u201ctruth\\u201d being built upon from lies.\\nTurning a blind eye is a large theme within the idea of \\u201cthe god-trick\\u201d and is iterated upon in Nietzsche\\u2019s description of the \\u201cleaf.\\u201d The leaf is a broad example of this created by \\u201cdisregarding... differences and forgetting distinguishing aspects\\u201d (On Truth and Lying in an Extra-Moral Sense, 24). What is described here is that humans cannot label an \\\"essential quality\\\" for anything they describe. In essence, it is understood that there are many different types of leaves but we are not able to explain the explicit differences among them and in doing so what arises is a lack of \\u201ctruth'' with the leaf. The fault lies in the generalization of the leaf and applying this generalization to other contexts is where the fault lies, which is exactly what Haraway addresses in her \\u201cgod-trick\\u201d illusion. The very definition of \\u201cthe god-trick\\u201d includes generalizing our own knowledge to compensate for the holes in our discovery and knowledge.\\nThrough years of scientific advancement and gain in understanding our world, the so-called truths that humans have established may have faults resulting from the way the scientific method approaches them. Haraway suggests that our way of utilizing objectivity needs to reworked to be more inclusive and Nietzsche\\u2019s writings extend upon this idea and exemplify how these truths may have fault in them as a result of assumptions. These assumptions built on top of each other lead to the lack of understanding that both authors argue.\\nEuphoria is a feeling when you perceive everything to be super good.

Before proactively taking action to grow the relationship it is essential you first ensure you uphold exceptional neighborly behavior. For example, ensuring loud noises like vacuuming is done during day time and making an effort to upkeep your outdoor space to uplift the shared spaces of your homes. A thoughtful and polite neighbor is more likely to befriend those living around them. There are some ways to build relationships. First, ensure you greet your neighbor with a friendly gesture, such as a wave or a brief verbal greeting, every time you see them. Second, keep a watchful eye for the opportunity to do something friendly for your neighbor. For example, offer to help them if you see them attempting to carry a heavy item. Third, identify a proactive, planned gesture such as offering them a baked sweet around a holiday. Fourth, seek the opportunity to ask them about something they care about. For example, inquire how their work is going or a recent family event they may have mentioned. Fifth, invite them to your home for a meal.

On the one hand: minimally invasive operations tend to have faster recovery times, less blood loss, and smaller incisions (which is good from an aesthetic perspective as it means smaller scars). On the other hand, minimally invasive options might not provide as much visibility into the surgical site as an open incision would, and depending on the procedure might not promote the type of fusion required. Of course, any surgical decision should be made by a trained and qualified physician and will depend entirely on the specific circumstances presented by the patient.\\nGetting hives at night could mean that you have come into contact that triggers the allergic reaction.

In support of energy metabolism, carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to be oxidized for free energy production, and also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Generally individuals, including strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo.\\n\\nCarnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers d-carnitine (S-(+)-) and l-carnitine (R-(\\u2212)-)). Both are biologically active, but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form. At room temperature, pure carnitine is a whiteish powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with relatively low toxicity. Derived from amino acids, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, \\\"caro\\/carnis\\\" or flesh.\\n\\nSome individuals with genetic or medical disorders (such as preterm infants) cannot make enough carnitine, requiring dietary supplementation.

As a recreational drone pilot you can capture and immortalize the incredible views experienced in nature while engaging in many outdoor activities. Many also engage in racing and building highly customized high speed drones using first person view (FPV) goggles to fly against other pilots in a close loop course. Before engaging in this fun and rewarding activity there are many rules that a drone pilot must be aware of in order to safely and legally operate your drone. These rules do not apply to racing drones in sanctioned races but do apply to all drones flown in public airspace.  All drones over 0.55lbs or 250g need to be registered through the FAA website and can not weigh over 55lbs.  If you plan to fly your drone over highly populated areas such as towns, sporting events, or concerts you will need to check local rules and ordinances that require special local licensing, insurance, or approvals.  Many higher end drones come with automated software that provides a geospatial mapping software in their interface that lets you know if you are flying in any restricted areas.  These include airports, helipads, government facilities, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.  All hobbyist drone pilots must follow two main rules.  You can never fly above 400 feet and regardless of range you must keep the drone within line of sight.  You are completely responsible for any damage your drone causes in the event of loss of control that results in a crash.  Lastly, use common sense and don\\u2019t invade others' personal space or to invade others\\u2019 personal privacy.  Staying within these guidelines can provide a joyful and rewarding experience for those who both fly and view the content produced by this hobby and will ensure our ability to do so into the future.\\nLearning to fly an airplane is a fun and rewarding endeavor.  There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.  This may sound expensive, but it's worth it to have a skill that you can enjoy for a lifetime.\\nTaking longer airplane flights with children can be stressful.  With some planning you can alleviate some of the stress and keep yourself and your children ready for the journey.  In preparation for your trip make sure that you cover the basics of food, hydration, entertainment and comfort.  Food: While most longer flights will offer refreshments, not all flights have full meal options available.  Prepare by eating a meal before getting on the plane and by packing a range of snack options for you and your children.  Hydration:  You will likely be served refreshments and drinks several times during longer flights.  However you will likely find that you will need to bring additional water and drink options to ensure proper hydrations, especially on very long flights. Entertainment:  You want to make sure that your children can engage in plenty of activities on long flights.  Most airlines will provide for games, movies and music options via on board entertainment.  However, you want to make sure you supplement by bringing additional entertainment options for your children.  Comfort:  Your plane can be too cold or too warm for your preferences, so be prepared for both scenarios.\\naround 70 remain airworthy\"},{\"type_label\":\"response_cluster::resp_B49\",\"count\":61,\"prevalence\":0.0040636866,\"id\":151,\"type\":\"response_cluster\",\"label\":\"resp_B49\",\"color\":\"#FFFF99\",\"shape\":\"ellipse\",\"title\":\"resp_B49\\n(response_cluster, 61 examples)\\nDowncountry mountain bikes first came onto the scene around 2020 as an intersection between hard tail XC bikes and longer travel downhill\\/enduro bikes.

The Opel-RAK program and the spectacular public demonstrations of ground and air vehicles drew large crowds, as well as caused global public excitement as so-called \\\"Rocket Rumble\\\" and had a large long-lasting impact on later spaceflight pioneers like Wernher von Braun. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \\\"Space Race\\\" between the Soviet Union and the United States. The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\\n\\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth\\u2013Moon L1, the Moon, Earth\\u2013Sun L2, near-Earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.\"},{\"type_label\":\"response_cluster::resp_B57\",\"count\":149,\"prevalence\":0.0099260542,\"id\":159,\"type\":\"response_cluster\",\"label\":\"resp_B57\",\"color\":\"#FFFF99\",\"shape\":\"ellipse\",\"title\":\"resp_B57\\n(response_cluster, 149 examples)\\nThe Earth\\u2019s equator gets more concentrated light and heat from the sun due to the curvature of the earth.

Clear weather is required with little cloud coverage to get the best view.\\nThere are several strong arguments against concluding that alien races built the structures like the Stonehenge or the Pyramids. First, there is evidence that these magnificent structures were built by humans. For example, tombs of the pyramid builders were found in the vicinity of the Great Pyramind (with human remains!). The technology to move and assemble the massive stones of the Stonehenge has been shown to be available to humans at that time. Second, given that space is vast the chance of finding one tiny planet among billions is infinitesimal. If alien intelligence had indeed found our one inhabited planet they are unlikely to have just created couple of structures and avoided any further contact with Earth and its inhabitants. In science, Occam\\u2019s Razor (\\u201cthe best explanation is the simplest one\\u201d) is a guiding principle and until there is much more evidence of alien visitation it would be inadvisable to jump to a conclusion that aliens built these structures.\\nSunlight streaming through, \\nLightning in the sky, \\nMy spirits lift.\\nThe different types of galaxies include: Irregular, spiral, and elliptical.

Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von K\\u00f6lliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \\\"powerhouse of the cell\\\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\\n\\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\\n\\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 \\u03bcm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\\n\\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\\n\\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\\\"mitogenome\\\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy.\\nPhotosynthesis is a process in plants that converts energy from light into chemical energy.\\nFor most recreational diving atmospheric air with 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen is used. The second most common mixture is Enriched Air Nitrox which contains extra oxygen with 32% or 36% and less Nitrogen than is found in atmospheric air, which permits divers to have shorter safety stops or shorter surface intervals.\\nClimate change is dangerous as it alters the climate very rapidly leading to shift in seasons and damaging the habitats of wild life for example. Some ways to control it could be: \\n1. Reduce air pollution - move towards electric vehicles. Also move towards renewable source of energy so that increased demand can be met.\\n2. Control ozone depletion - Ban use of chemicals that encourage ozone hole depletion as this leads to melting of polar ice caps.\\n3. Plant more trees - They help in regulating the environment.\\nOkay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\\n\\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\\n\\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s. It's such a new finding, and it's totally changed the world. Science rules!\\nWhen you blow air into alkaline water the C02 from your breath creates carbonic acid which lowers the potential hydrogen of the alkaline water.  If you blow air into the alkaline water long enough the alkaline water will eventually turn acidic.  Potential hydrogen drops can be used to measure the PH to show the effect of blowing air into alkaline water.

The difference is that ultimate frisbee is a team sport that combines several of the rules of football, basketball and soccer. Like football, a team takes possession of the frisbee and tries to move it down field and into an end zone. Like basketball, once you are in possession of the frisbee, you cannot move your pivot foot. However, there is no \\\"dribbling\\\" with a frisbee so if a player has possession of the frisbee outside of their end zone, they have to pass it before they can move their pivot foot.

Frisbee golf, on the other hand, follows the rules of golf, except that the player throws a frisbee to the hole instead of hitting a ball with clubs. Some people play the sport on dedicated frisbee golf courses, using a set of specialized discs of various weights and carrying them in a bag from hole to hole like a golfer would do with their set of clubs.

Assume they hit a strong drive of 275 yards, and land in the fairway.  Now their expected score for the hole might be 3.8.  Since their expected score went from 4.0 to 3.8 as a result of the drive, they gained .2 strokes with the drive.\\n\\nIf you repeat this for every shot in a round of golf, you would gain a picture of strokes gained for the overall round.\\n\\nOne key to strokes gained is what an expected score is for each hole.  This was first calculated for tour pro players when shot by shot stats were available via the ShotLink system used in pro events.  With the advent of consumer-level shot tracking systems, it is now possible to generated expected scores for virtually all levels of golfers, and thus any golfer can track strokes gained for their round, as compared to any level of golfer.\\n\\nStrokes gained is typically further broken down into 4 categories : Off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.\\n\\nThe insights available once strokes gained was available has allowed insights into what really allows golfer to separate themselves from their competition.  Most notably, strokes gained was able to show that skill in driving is much more of a separator than is putting skill.  This went against many decades of conventional wisdom.\\nPer the PGA (Professional Golfers' Association), a player can carry up to 14 clubs in their bag.

To help him cope, she arranged for him to receive a beagle puppy. A few days later, John is accosted at a gas station outside of New York City by a group of Russian gangsters, led by Iosef, who fail to intimidate John into selling them his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.\\n\\nLearning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \\\"Baba Yaga,\\\" a ruthless and relentless \\\"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will.\\\" After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly \\\"impossible task\\\" to earn his freedom.\\n\\nJohn recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal \\\"business\\\" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.\\n\\nAs John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.\\n\\nAt the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.\\n\\nPerkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning the walk home.\\nHamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, King Lear, Much Ado About Nothing\\n1.

First figure out your travel arrangements.  If you are able to drive, you will have your own vehicle available to travel to the parks.  If you fly, you will either need a rental car or will need to use other forms of transportation, such as uber or lyft.  Within the Walt Disney World parks and resorts there is Disney provided transportation, but it is often crowded during peak hours such as park opening and closing.  Next you will need to decide where to stay.  The Walt Disney World resorts are the most convenient, but also the most expensive option.  There are Walt Disney World resorts cater to different economic levels from more affordable up to more luxurious.  Staying on the grounds will also often allow to enter parks earlier or stay later than the general public.  Staying off the grounds is usually less expensive.  There are many hotels and resorts in the Orlando area to choose from.  Other options are to use a rental service such as VRBO or AirBnB to rent a property such as a house or condo for your stay.  Next you need to decide on how many days in the parks you'll spend and whether you will stay in one park for an entire day or want to have the option to \\\"park hop\\\".  Tickets are discounted for a larger number of days in the park.  The \\\"park hopper\\\" option is a premium on top of the base ticket price.  Often there are discount ticket websites but be careful about scams.  The safest is to buy from Disney or a licensed travel advisor.  Typically the price from a travel advisor is they same as buying from Disney.  Next make a budget for how much you'll spend on food in the parks.  Food is fairly pricy, but there are options from counter service all the way up to sit down restaurants and fine dining.  Realize that eating in a sit down restaurant will take time away from other activities in the parks.  Reservations can be made on the Disney website but are often difficult to get for some restaurants.  Taking food into the park is also an option as there are lockers available at the parks to store things.  Some items such as knives are not allowed, so plan ahead if food needs to be sliced.  Next look at the rides and attractions that your family wants to ride and make a plan for which are the most important.  A guidebook such as the Unauthorized Guide to Disney World is very helpful to provide plans for your day(s) in the parks.  These guidebooks will give you help on when the lines for attractions will be shorter.  Don't just try to show up in a park without some sort of plan as to which attractions to visit and when.  Visiting without a plan will result in frustration, long waits, and disappointment.  Also realize that you will not be able to visit all of the park attractions in one visit.  As the time of your visit approaches watch the weather reports.  Late afternoon thunderstorms are typical in Orlando in the summertime.  Most attractions at Disney World are indoors and will continue operating during rain.  Rain ponchos can be purchased in the park, but they are more expensive in park than if you bring your own.  It can also be very hot during the summer, so plan on having water, sunscreen and wearing appropriate clothing for the weather.  Be aware of how your party's attitude is during your visit.  Visiting Disney World requires a lot of walking and also requires stamina.  If people are getting tired, take a break, either in the park or back at your hotel.  Don't make your visit a \\\"death march\\\".  Also base the length of your stay in the park on the age of people in your party.  Young children or elderly may require longer and more frequent breaks.  One option is to go to the park in the morning, go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool, and return to the park later afternoon or evening.  Pay attention to the park hours to know how early you can arrive and how late you can stay.  Most parks have some sort of parade and fireworks show at closing.  Most are very worthwhile to see.  And remember above all that you should have fun.  Don't be so focused on your plan of visiting attractions that you don't take advantage of spur of the moment opportunities such as interacting with characters or getting a quick photo with the family.  Hopefully this will not be your only vacation at Disney World, and you want to have fond memories of your visit so that you will want to return again as soon as possible.\"},{\"type_label\":\"response_cluster::resp_B90\",\"count\":236,\"prevalence\":0.015721804,\"id\":192,\"type\":\"response_cluster\",\"label\":\"resp_B90\",\"color\":\"#FFFF99\",\"shape\":\"ellipse\",\"title\":\"resp_B90\\n(response_cluster, 236 examples)\\nBunnie XO\\nKorean dramas or Kdramas have been popular for over 2 decades now. However, the rise in popularity shot up during the pandemic. Kdramas were initially watched by people in Southeast Asian countries and in some places in South Asia. When the pandemic hit, a lot of Kdramas were available on Netflix making it easier for people to watch them. With word of mouth, this soon spread and more and more users were watching Kdramas. Netflix took advantage of this viewership and started making dramas of their own or buying rights for dramas to be streaming exclusively on Netflix.
