# sentence-embedding-demos
Fun, interesting, and maybe useful things to do with sentence embeddings.

We consider sentence embedding models to be a simple type of "foundation model" because they are generally trained (by someone else) on a large corpus of data, and they produce very general semantic representations that can be used in a wide variety of applications. We show examples using both [Hugging Face Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers), which are small enough to install locally on a laptop, and [GPT3 embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings) which require calling OpenAI services.
